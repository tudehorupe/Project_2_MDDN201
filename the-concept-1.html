					<h1>The Concept</h1>
					<p class="p-offset-2">The act of global warming and pollution is heavily apart of society today with many oblivious to the impacts this has. This not only impacts the natural environment, but the likes of individuals in areas where access to appropriate measures to avoid these toxins is difficult to come by (Mawle, 2010). Due to the worldwide nature of this issue, the chosen medium of an online publication to display relevant content has been decided upon in order to obtain a broader audience. Given this, a vast range of content is necessary to best appeal to user needs and desires, therefore, having this information broken up into key areas is crucial for usability.</p>

					<div class="the-concept-1-description">
						<p>Areas such as societies impacts, personal impacts, and solutions have been decided upon, given the range of content this presents. Within these areas, particular forms of information such as; facts, trends, history of impacts, as well as external references are crucial to include. </p>

						<p>For societies impact, the use of; facts, trends and history will be crucial aspects to include as they provide information which will present the harsh truth of societies current status. This information will therefore act as a reality check for many, encouraging individuals to better understand how large this issue is. It then of course needs to be backed up and relatable to other sites which have credibility and extensive research into these issues. Sites such as <a class="external-link" href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/environment/global-warming/pollution/" target="_blank">National Geographic</a> and <a class="external-link" href="https://climate.nasa.gov/" target="_blank">NASA</a> are each appropriate displays of current platforms proving similar information in a stylistic way. Other external sources like the New York Times <a class="external-link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/section/climate" target="_blank">‘Climate and Environment’</a> section as well as scholarly readings are also significant links to include as these both offer relevant support to this issue. Through linking to these sites, this will create a network for which users are able to obtain further external information, thus becoming more informed with their impacts.</p>

						<p>Unlike these sites however, it is difficult to measure more personal impacts on the environment, resulting in the inclusion of this unique aspect. The result of this is the ability for individuals to track global, national, regional, local and personal impacts in a more precise manner. Having users enter specifications to the site, relevant information would appear based on this desired search allowing them to pinpoint different impacts. The act of having this inclusion to the site, offers the ability for users to better understand impacts on the environment at different scales rather than only being told about general issues. It will provide the opportunity for these general issues to be narrowed down and better tracked, further assisting awareness.</p>

						<p>Based on these two areas which present the issues, a solutions area is ideal to assist in creating change. Much like these other areas, external links to other sites will allow content being displayed to be better backed up. For these solutions, it is crucial to present this appropriately so that users will remember and refer to these findings to improve their impact.</p>

						<p>Each of these three main areas of this site will offer different information which will however overlap and allow the site to work in harmony. Users would effectively go though each of these main areas following one after the other to best understand environmental impacts. Due to this, the design of this site is crucial to be simplistic to follow as well as being informative to create memorability and long-term change.</p>
