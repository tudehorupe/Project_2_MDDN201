					<h1>Moving forward</h1>
					<p class="p-offset-2">As previously stated, there is significant potential for this concept of exposing human impacts on the environment to be better related to the physical world. That is not saying though that the current medium of an online publication is an insignificant approach to creating this awareness, but that the inclusion of a physical aspect will create a more relatable cohesion for individuals to better understand their impacts.</p>
					<div class="moving-forward-main-text">
						<p>This proposed development would be the inclusion of a means for individuals to better monitor impacts on the environment from their current location more easily. This will then create a more relevant design, which will create a link to the online platform effectively.</p>

						<p>To push for this development of the website into individuals’ daily lives, this concept needs to provide more than just impacts and solutions. Due to this, the inclusion of offering weather will make this more relatable. Providing similar information to what <a class="external-link" href="https://www.metservice.com/national/home?gclid=EAIaIQobChMIluT70LmD5AIVmqqWCh0rVQBoEAAYASAAEgIapvD_BwE" target="_blank">MetService</a> currently does would generate more usage since users seek to commonly check the weather. Offering this side aspect of weather is also extremely relatable to this environmental concept as a lot of this information will overlap. Having users check the weather and then be able to check environmental impacts in that same area too, will be considerably useful and engaging with a vast range of individuals.</p>

						<p>Through also presenting this development in the form of an app, this will ensure that users will constantly have access to this information. Given a study of 2000 British smartphone owners, it was discovered that the average adult spent three hours and 25 minutes on their phone every day <a class="external-link" href="https://www.express.co.uk/life-style/life/1165745/phone-usage-average-adult-social-media-britain-study" target="_blank">(Express, 2019)</a>. Due to this, it therefore results in an app being an optimal choice for this development.</p>

						<p>From this, information on the online publication will then need to be modified to meet these changes, allowing users to search current weather and log in to track their personal habits. These modifications to this concept ultimately will allow this content to become more relatable therefore a means to visit this site more frequently. </p>
